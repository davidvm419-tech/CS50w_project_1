# CS50W Project 1: Wiki

This is my implementation of CS50W’s Project 1. 
It allows users to browse, search, create, edit, and view encyclopedia entries written in Markdown.

---

## Features

### 1. Index Page
Displays a list of all encyclopedia entries.

### 2. Entry Page
Shows the content of a selected entry.  
Markdown is converted to HTML using the markdown2 library.

### 3. Search
- Exact match → redirects to the entry page  
- Partial match → shows a list of related entries  

### 4. Create New Page 
Users can create a new entry using a form. If the entry already exists, an error message is displayed. 

### 5. Edit Page 
Users can edit an existing entry. The textarea is pre-filled with the current Markdown content. 

### 6. Random Page 
Redirects the user to a random entry. 

### 7. Styling
Custom CSS and a sidebar layout were added to improve the UI. A logo was included using Django’s static file system.
